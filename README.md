### 👋 Hi, I’m @Sophie-IA — A Curious Data Explorer
I love transforming messy datasets into meaningful insights and building cool stuff with Python, SQL, and Power BI. I dive deep, visualize smarter, and always code with purpose.

💡 Currently working on:  
- Predictive models (like customer churn & sales forecasting)  
- Dashboards from ETL pipelines  
- A Python chess game (console ➝ GUI ➝ tkinter)  
- Data storytelling with real-world datasets

🎯 Personal Goals:  
- Master key data analytics tools  
- Stay fit while coding full-time  
- Achieve financial freedom through focus and growth

🛠️ Let’s turn data into direction!
